# opti4Abq 2.0.3

An optimisation method in Python 2.X that runs on a set of abaqus models to minimise the difference (in a least square sense) between the FEA output and a corresponding set of data

The following Python modules are used: scipy.optimize, subprocess, numpy, and importlib if run with Python 2.7
